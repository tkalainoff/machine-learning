The biggest problem is the first section which had the  \"\"proposed benefits of basic income\"\" topic removed.

Also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links, but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog.  Meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content.

      " Basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients, or find and punish abusers.\n",
      " Basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions (such as social security in the US) is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened\n",
      " Reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation.\n",
      " Balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation, and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work.\n",
      " Better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up.\n",
      " Smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction.  Viewed this way, the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen, even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation.\n",
      " Social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically, with less requirement on charity and welfare.\n",
      " It is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income.  Its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner.\n",
      " Natural finance's definition of social dividends (variable basic income: tax revenue surplus over social program expenses) essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic, productivity, and automation growth.

He was a pope and is pope emeritus, so his article's title should remain as close to the established convention as possible. The fact that he stepped down is not a compelling reason to drastically deviate. Nothing in what you say makes any logical argument for why \"\"Benedict XVI\"\" is the best form for a pope emeritus. In other words, in the formulation \"\"Because X, the unmodified regnal name is the most appropriate for a pope emeritus\"\", you have yet to supply X. This seems to be more about your personal preference than rules or logic. Also, since the article should match the other popes after he dies, what we are really talking about is what to call him while he is alive. Does it really make sense to drop \"\"Pope\"\" then add it back? What is the difference? Keeping the article where it is no more suggests he is the current pope than Pope John Paul II does or that Queen Victoria suggests she remains a current monarch. Even in the unlikely situation that someone arrived here from \"\"Random article\"\" and momentarily thought he was still pope, that would be cured immediately by the lead, the resignation section, and the discussion of his pontificate in the past tense. No case has been made for this change, so I don't see why you expect everyone to agree to make it. -  \"\n",

Those dialects became known as \"\"Languages\"\" after diversification. Ishmael with his mother moved to the Arabic concentrated area. Ishmael learned Arabic and married an Arab girl. He begot Arab children from their mothers side. Those children again married Arab. This continued until those children became a big tribe called Quraysh or Quraish, reknowed for the perfection of their dialect of Arabic & for being a strong and honored tribe among the Arabs. Their DNA would have been diluted nearly completely by the Arab tribe Ishmael joined. But as we know the Y chromasome is passed down by the father. Hence it is relavent to state that Quraysh's male population would have had a great affinity geneticly to Ishmael, the non-Arab. Yet Maternaly they would have had a greater affinity to the other Arab tribes. by BB\"\n",

Roads to Freedom makes patent his political promiscuity: Russell was willing to support any movement that would tend to push history towards human freedom, humane social relations, and the rational satisfaction of human needs.  (Although when nuclear war was concerned, he seemed to prefer social injustice to complete ruin).  On the other hand, Russell was deeply skeptical of technology and science in its influence on human society and culture.  The Scientific Outlook was his vision of a scientific dystopia—one which incorporates much of technocracy.  (For the uninitiated: it is somewhat similar to Brave New World).  Although the technocratic elements are not necessarily portrayed in a negative light, they are not left blameless for the resulting society.

So BMK has a double standard: one for him, and the opposite for me (and presumably everyone else). I give respect to those who give me respect; most often I have been treated by him with dismissive disdain.\n",

      " is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. I agree with him, and, unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised, I support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. My reason for this: it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at RfAr/Clarification, and that I was blocked while this request was pending, for comments made in the request itself, is an additional impediment.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no need for extra debate or argument. I have stated that I am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which I interpreted the sanction, pending clarification by ArbComm. So the status quo is that the restriction is tight, though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. I do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits, and I'd argue that he did so consider. I accepted Sandstein's decision (\"\"clarification\"\") as a neutral administrator, pending ArbComm review, not Future Perfect's who was already involved, and I had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.\n",

      "I will continue to respect Sandstein's tightening as standing and binding on me, and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated, and it did permit legitimate comment before ArbComm, when I am an originating party, as is normal. Normally, I can, having filed, respond there to comments from other editors, also made there, which is what I did. ArbComm specifically allowed me to originate a case, and if I'm clearly involved as well, I see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors, and I will avoid, in such a filing, if it happens, unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. Obviously, if I file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin, I will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required, which would only mention other disputes peripherally, and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.\n",

      "I hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual RfAr than there has been to the existing RfAr/Clarification, which, as it stands, includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material I filed. It's been pointed out by , with clerk attention requested, and nothing was done. Nevertheless, if the request is closed without action, it's moot. The real point here is that if clerks were following filings before ArbComm, surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved, and possibly the editor warned.   \"\n",

As this reduces the channel floodwater capacity, the creek will over time seek new, lower paths, forming meanders (a curving sinuous path). The leftover higher locations, typically natural levees at the margins of the flood channel, will themselves be eroded by lateral stream erosion and from local rainfall and possibly wind transport if the climate is arid and does not support soil-holding grasses.

This both preserves the page history intact and automatically creates a redirect from the old title to the new.

Many others here have covered these issues over and over and the page has been approved by two administrators in regard to the eschatology section. My edits were reverting, not altering the main text sections. I only edited the last 1995 bit, and you've said nothing about that, except made unfounded claims.

It hardly takes a brain surgeon to change a prediction, where the world is still looking on, long after the end was supposed have arrived! You also are trying to use very deceitful terminologies to try and pacify the facts to more and more insignificance, when they were anything but that at their times of publishing. An example of your gross dishonesty is here where you say “Other dates variously considered being time of God's judgement”. Since when were they “variously considered”? They forcefully stated, “we affirm that, Scripturally, scientifically, and historically, present-truth chronology is correct beyond a doubt. Its reliability has been abundantly confirmed. . .” and “This chronology is not of man, but of God. Being of divine origin and divinely corroborated, present-truth chronology stands in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct.” What you inserted was gross fabrication and deceit Ben.

      "\n",
      "Hello: having worked on Angola for more than four decades, I have over the last two years or so tried to improve articles on Angola in WP (several languages). I was thus delighted to see your recent work on the en:WP article on the Angolan Civil War, which is a period I have somewhat neglected with regard to the military side. I wonder whether we can agree on the following points:\n",
      " The civil war in Angola ran from 1975 to 2002. The war for independence stopped effectively in April 1974, although a formal peace agreement was signed in January 1975 only. What I call the \"\"decolonization conflict\"\" is the fight between the nationalist movements & allies from April 1974 to November 1975 (independence). This conflict becomes a civil war after independence. Civil war can be divided in two periods: until 1991 (Cuban and South African military involvement) and 1991-2002 (external support only). I think this periodization is important, because it permits to specify the participation of other countries.\n",
      " There was direct participation of Cuba and SA in the fighting in 1974/75 as well as in 1975-1991. \n",
      " I have never heard of the involvement of French & Morroccan troops: what are your sources? \n",
      " The support of the Soviet Union consisted of air transport for Cuban troops, furnishing military equipment, and a few advisors, mostly in 1974/75, less in 1975-1991.\n",
      " Zaire supported the FNLA (logistics, equipment) and (small) contingents of troops, mainly in 1974/75, less so in 1975-1991 (when, as far as I know, the FNLA ceased it military activity as early as 1976/77)\n",
      " The US gave UNITA logistical, material and diplomatic support 1975-1991.\n",
      " China gave the FNLA some (unspecified) support in the early 1960s, and shifted this support (which then included military training in China for come cadres) to UNITA after 1966. This is uncontested  see e.g. John Marcum's book.\n",
      " Algeria supported the MPLA 1961-1974, mainly by hosting a pivotal group of MPLA exile cadres. I don't know about any further support.\n",
      " I don't have any sources on Libyan involvement.\n",
      " I am quite surprised at you mentioning the FNLC: what are the sources?\n",
      " Gabon and Côte d'Ivoire: I don't have sources, either.\n",
      " Mozambique: the FRELIMO regime has given \"\"fraternal\"\" moral and diplomatic support to the MPLA from the 1960s onwards, but as far as I know, there was no military involvement (so much the less as there was a civil war going on in Mozambique as well).\n",

I would support however some sort of guidelines for arbs (and maybe admins) regarding what sort of complaints are clear reason for status change, and what are perhaps valid but less clearcut, and then, if the latter, some sort of discussion, maybe per RfC with a crat closing, regarding the conduct of the individual involved and how to deal with it. Personally, I think the \"\"us\"\" AGK used is potentially problematic, but could just be, potentially, a typo. Arbs are not necessarily required to write all comments like legal briefs, particularly if they themselves are not necessarily lawyers. Of course, if AGK, or any other arb in a potentially similar position, were to resign on their own, should that happen, that might be enough to address that specific situation, but no one should see my saying that as necessarily indicating I think such would necessarily be the way to proceed in this instance, because I don't think the matter necessarily rises to that level.

If you notice, there was already a video clip of Dr. Holtzapple giving a presentation (reference #2 in present version), but in that clip he presents about a lot of things, whereas in the ones I added, he concentrates only on Bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohols fuels.

      "conclusions from PMID 23512950, Harrow 2013 Overall, the longitudinal studies cited do not provide conclusive proof of a causal relationship between being off medications and being psychosis free. They do clearly indicate that not all schizophrenia patients need continuous antipsychotics for a prolonged period, providing extensive evidence of samples of medication-free schizophrenia patients with favorable outcomes.6,12,22 Is it at least a moderate-sized number of schizophrenia patients who do well, longitudinally, without medications? This important issue needs longitudinal research for more precise answers. The longitudinal studies indicate the importance of further research on how many schizophrenia patients profit from continuous administration of antipsychotics over a prolonged period, what factors identify and separate schizophrenia patients who do not need prolonged antipsychotic treatment, and whether or not prolonged use of antipsychotics is harmful for some or many patients.\n",

Discussions by Whitaker, Moncrieff, and others question long-term antipsychotic treatment.25–27 These disparate views, research by WHO and DOSMED in developing countries,12 and our own longitudinal studies5–7 should be considered as prompts for further long-term outcome research on this important issue.  This is not a strongly worded conclusion, where our article presents as fact what this article appears to be raising as an important question in need of further study.  I continue to believe this is not a strong enough source for the cited text.  Clearly, further research on this controversial matter is needed.  Can we either eliminate this source or reword the text to better match?  The strongest conclusion of this paper is that further study is needed.  Regards,  (Talk) \"\n",

      "Well, once again you are ignoring several facts about what happened in Peru during those years. Let me explined them to you in a easy way so you can understand a lot better about peruvia politics:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Fujimori, as President of the Republic, was invited to a asiatic forum that was held in Brunei, 2001. During those days, The Opposition parties manage to impeach Dra. MArtha Hildebrant, President of the Congress and member of Peru 2000, Fujimori´s political Party. It was widely know that they would try to impeach Fujimori from Office. They did it 2 times, and in the last vote (wich was extremely controvertial) they succeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 16 de septiembre: Fujimori llama a nuevas elecciones generales y dice que no participará. (Reuters y Dpa). Fujimori WAS PRESENT in Peru after the Vladi-video. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Peruvian Congressman Javier Diez Canseco is one of the most untrusted members of this failed parlament. If you didn't know, he was an active member of the EXTREME Left during the times of the Civil War here in Peru. He was involve in several scandals during the 80's for his open suport to Sendero Luminoso. He was in China (representing Peru in that Communist country) at the time of the self-coup, and he lost his seat in the chamber of deputies after that. It is not surpricely that he had exagerated much of the information that he use and his open hate towards the former President is widely know. Besides that, Public enterprises here in Peru where already collapsing becouse of the saturisation of APRA Party Members in those institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Peru is in resecion for other motives. Since when international financial crisis does not affect some countries? you are ignoring the fact that during 1997 there was also a mayor political crisis her due to the hostages in the Japanese emmbassy. \n",
      "\n",
      "- The Constitution of 1993 IS NOT retroactive. Fujimori was elected with the 1979 constitution. According to some lawyers, this make him possible to run for a 2th term under that constitution. (he was democraticaly eleccted in 1995 with the 1993 constitution.) It was controvertial, it's true. But most of the power struggle here was caused by the fact that the most important (before the 90's) political parties in Peru were already tired of being ignored by the electorated.\n",
      "\n",
      "- If you are trying to sell me the idea that the poor terrorist were slaughter with no feeling by the Army, you are completely wrong. May I remind you that it was a war zone? that the poor terrorist where armed with ak-74 and that they have and RPG inside the embassy? Oh, of course that Aministia international will defend them to death, since is their job to do that. I agree with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe when he said that they only care about terrorist and not their victims. once again, this is a patetic effort by yours to rewrite history.\n",
      "\n",
      "- That order was removed several days latter due to the fact that it created a political storm here, becouse Fomer President Alan Garcia is also accused with the same and is free walking around Lima. Due to political Pressure by the APRA, it was removed, and if you know, that minister was already fire from his post.\n",

      "Find any other equivalent. You guys have changed the entire subject. The fact of the matter is that you can not call ethnic groups prior to 1919 as Azerbaijani; there was no such defined identity. Why are there articles on the Dutchy? The Dutchy were more defined as a group than were the Turkic peoples living in those lands… why not plain German? And again, Parishan is using Russian and Soviet propaganda material, which maintained such a position, including for the Turks living in Armenia, to stop Turkey's expansionism… they had Turks in Nakhichevan and those in Armenia rather to adhere to an Azerbaijani identity than Turkish. But prior to the Soviet rules, those people were not identifying themselves, neither were they identified as such. I am wondering how much more can Parishan provide other than Soviet-Russian historiography which was known to be tainted when covering ethnic groups and ethno genesis, turning ethnic groups into groups that all originated from the identities forming the Union, some sort of Self-Sufficient system. This process already started during the end of the Russian Empire, Roy writes: In Azerbaijan for a brief period (the governorate of Vorontsov in the 1850s, and that of Goltsyn from 1896 to 1905), the Russians encouraged the development of an Azeri identity in order to weaken links with Iran and Turkey (The New Central Asia The Creation of Nations by Olivier Roy I.B.Tauris, (2000) p.56)\n",
      "\n",
      "During the process, many different groups were pushed into being identified as ethnically Azerbaijani, including Kurds, who haven't until recently when groups wanted their independence requested their identity to be changed: In 1988 some 10,000 Kurds in Azerbaijan returned their Azeri identity papers to Moscow with the explicit request that their identity be changed from Azeri to Kurd.

(Socialism in Georgian Colors: The European Road to Social Democracy, 1883-1917, Harvard University Press (2005) p. 19)\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, another quote missed by Parishan: In Contrast with the Armenians, the Azerbaijani national identity is very recent. In fact, the very name \"\"Azerbaijani\"\" was not widely used until the 1930s; before that, Azerbaijani intellectuals were unsure whether they should call themselves Caucasian Turks, Muslims, Tatars or something else.

If families start communicating with their children, helping their children, and supporting the things their children accomplish, there will be a smaller amount of gang members.

The debate as I see it is between providing a useful article for readers desiring information not otherwise contained in Wikipedia, and providing something basically inaccurate. For example, Brooklyn Beckham (the son of footballer David Beckham) was deemed not notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia article. Hence the link from Brooklyn Beckham redirects to the \"\"Personal life\"\" section of his dad's article. Not strictly accurate, but probably the most useful link for people who want to know about Brooklyn. In the absence of an article about Gadara (Umm Qais), if there was no other article related to Gadara, the same might apply to the redirect to Legion (demon). The alternative would be to create a stub article which basically has just one or two lines of text, including a link tothe Legion (demon).

For confined rear turrets the pack was sometimes stored outside the turret in the fuselage, the gunner only needing to reach behind him to open the two rear doors of the turret and reach into the fuselage.

Several other sites suggest that numerals should not be used whenever the number can be written out in words (obviously, this would mean that numerals should not be used up to one hundred, and also for other numbers such as three hundred or ten million).

We've developed the criteria for assessing schools as we've gone along. It probably doesn't make that much difference if a school is top or high, but the idea is to have at least one top importance school from each country. So far we've found the alumni to be one of the most effective ways to judge a school's importance but the system is inevitably subjective. These three Norwegian schools are amongst the oldest in the world and there might well be a case for making them all top importance, especially if they were indeed the only schools in the country for many centuries. It's very difficult to compare the three, especially when the articles are so short. I think it might be best to wait until the articles have been expanded and then request a re-assessment.\n",

There is no reason even to bring up the mathematically complicated natural/free convection when forced convection (the common type that happens in car radiators) works just as well as illustration. Choaygame is technically and perfectly correct that only internal energy (not heat) can be advected as a bulk flow of matter containing energy within it and moved from here to there. That means heat pumps don't really pump heat but rather energy. Heat cannot because heat cannot be stored in matter since the amount of it there, cannot even be defined!

They are markets for direction of transfer but cannot be used to quantitate how much energy is moved. That's a clue that they aren't fundamental and are in no way the core of what is happening physically. Physically it is potential energy being moved, not unlike moving a charged battery from here to there. It actually has nothing to do with \"\"heat\"\" in a thermodynamic sense. 18:46, 14\"\n",

There is no problem to build a transistor with more than Emitter or with more than one Collector and in fact these transistor variants really exist. A multi-basis transistor would be a transistor with one Emitter, one Collector and more than one Basis. I cannot imagine how this should be made. It is thus more likely that people use e.g. two transistors in a specific way that would allow to compensate the noise. This is how the basic idea for the bipolar transistor has been discovered by Herbert Mataré in 1942 while he was working on a Duodiode that should allow to compensate the noise in a mixer for a 3 GHz Radar receiver.

On the hypothesis that better sources build better articles as all of us here collaborate  to build an encyclopedia, I thought I would suggest some sources for improving articles on human genetic history and related articles.

By contrast, a secondary source summarizes one or more primary or secondary sources, usually to provide an overview of the current understanding of a medical topic. The general Wikipedia guidelines let us know that \"\"Articles should rely on secondary sources whenever possible. For example, a review article, monograph, or textbook is better than a primary research paper. When relying on primary sources, extreme caution is advised: Wikipedians should never interpret the content of primary sources for themselves.\"\" \n",

I really didn't believe I could get caught, however, I did. I am deeply sorry to have the community distrust me again. I have taken a month to think about what I have done and I am sorry to have done this. The first time I did a sock was to promote the Selena Project, however, I was also told about Jonaboy1992 (an old name I had used before I wanted to change it). I didn't know of the rule then, however, I agree that I should have been blocked for the other user I used to help promote the project. Now looking forward, I want to come back and continue to expand numerous articles as I was doing. I had expanded two articles in one day, I also had another Selena fan helping me with the Amor Prohibido page. I was teaching him the ropes of Wikipedia. I don't mind being mentored, however, Robert is the only person who stood by me. The last two came and go. I will admit, that I have some maturing to do if not a lot... however, Wikipedia is a community of people coming together to create a comprehensive site for information. Even though I was working by myself, I did worked well with others such as the GA reviews and translating articles from Arabic Wikipedians. I hope I can come back, I know that my English isn't the best even though I am a native speaker. Not everyone is perfect, and everyone has a strength... my strength is expanding Selena articles. While growing up with a family who had loved her before she was murdered and growing up with my mother who continued to play her songs, I grew to become very intelligent in Selena information. So its very easy to me to expand articles based on her. While away, I was working on several articles on the Simple Wikipedia. Thanks for accepting the apology, again it was very immature of me to do. Thanks,\n",

      "Hello Mareklug. Well, I believe that your request at WP:RFPP might have been declined due to the fact that the edit war was just starting and there was thus insufficient information of a full scale edit war that would have surely resulted in full protection to the article (by the way, that's how we call it: we don't \"\"block\"\" articles, we \"\"protect\"\" them). If the edit war continues, then do relist your request at WP:RFPP. It will likely to be accepted. I also have to agree that you might have failed to control yourself sometimes, when in the face of your opponent Tocino. Edit warring is never a good choice, as it only worsens a dispute and can indeed grant blocks to both of you (although I think that a topic ban would be quite an unlikely/draconian measure, you're not causing that much trouble as far as I see). My suggestion is, when Tocino (or any other user) makes an edit that you strongly disagree with, refrain from reverting right away and instead, summon the other party to the talk page. Then two things may happen: either he joins the discussion so you can both argue your points of view, or he doesn't join the discussion and provides you with a good reason for requesting an administrator's intervention against his unilateral actions. I hope this helps. Best regards, nd \"\n",

Although I know you're not a mediæval soldier, the retainer thing is a rather specific detail that really shouldn't appear unless we have a source for it — could you find something published by Fox, or something from somewhere else, noting that they'd officially retained you?

Another issue that I've just spotted is that there is quite a bit of movement between some frames, and some of the frames are a bit blurry (presumably motion blur? But I've noticed in some of the frames theres actually blur only one the right side of the frames and not in the centre... peculiar).. I assume you didn't use a sturdy tripod and the camera was blown around a bit by the wind? Also, because you used 4 frames to bracket, presumably you didn't auto bracket (or did you mention your camera doesn't auto bracket? I can't remember now), so you would have had to physically manipulate the camera to change exposures between frames, also resulting in camera movement... Hmmmm. Anyway, those movements between frames has buggered up one idea I was thinking of, which would have required pixel perfect alignment on each frame, but I'll still have a go with Photomatix as it can auto align...

      "\n",
      " This is quite a complex issue. There have been a few cases around the world where individual officials have solemnised marriages (e.g. France, Greece, Quintana Roo in Mexico). I don't think these jurisdictions should be included in the template, since there is no generalised recognition of same-sex marriage or possibility of generally entering into a legal same-sex marriage. However, what we have in Alagoas seems a bit different. I am prima facie in favour of including Alagoas based on the reasoning of User:Denisxavier. However, before we include Alagoas, we need a bit more information about how Brazilian marriage law works. In particular, I have two questions:\n",
      "\n",
      " *When an opposite-sex couple wants to enter into a marriage in Brazil, how do they do it? Are legal marriages registered at a Civil Registry Office, which conducts a civil ceremony and provides the marriage certificate? What is the role of the judge in these marriages? Also, what is a \"\"Notary\"\"? Are they a state official working in a Civil Registry Office, or a private person who can register marriages? The issue I am interested in here is: is the process for entering into a same-sex marriage identical to entering into an opposite-sex marriage in Alagoas? Or are there administrative / procedural differences?\n",
      " *Are Civil Registry Offices/Notaries obliged to register same-sex marriages in Alagoas, or are they merely allowed to do so? If they are not obliged to do so, then I think it's more problematic to include Alagoas in the template, because it means that the law is not being applied consistently.\n",
      "\n",
      " The fact that the highest federal court has not yet ruled on the matter is in my opinion irrelevant. When the Supreme Court of California legalised same-sex marriage in California, we still included it in the template, even if the Supreme Court of the US did not yet give its opinion. Wikipedia is flexible enough that it can accommodate to changing realities; if a superior court strikes down the lower court, then all we need to do is simply change the template again.

I also get the impression that you don't see that as a bad thing, but frustrating people into submission or Godwin's law isn't the way to win an individual argument or your NFC crusade. You're nominating images for deletion left, right and centre based on technicalities in the NFCC policy and NFC guideline without regard for their encyclopaedic benefit or the spirit of those rules and you're weathering editors down to the extent that you're driving them away from uploading images or even from contributing by tagging their images at a near-robotic speed and frequency. That's not what the rules are for, that's not what Twinkle is for (as your previous trips to ANI should have made you aware) and if that's what was in the best interests of the project, we'd have a bot doing it. You've been offered a perfectly dignified solution that would allow you to continue the good that you do while mitigating the negative effects in the form of a voluntary undertaking not to nominate more than two images per uploader per day. My advice to you would be to take the offer and save us all some time—the laternative is that somebody will take this to ANI or ArbCom and we all waste a lot of time with the result that you're formally restricted from doing what you could restrict yourself from voluntarily.  | Penny for your thoughts?   \"\n",

The proposal to restore the old version is also very puzzling in light of the fact that it was a hopeless quagmire, as people repeatedly documented.

If a conspiracy theory is a theory involving a \"\"coordinated group\"\" which \"\"is, or was, secretly working to commit illegal or wrongful actions, including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities\"\" then Operation Northwoods does not fit the criteria. First of all, the CIA does not try to keep its self hidden or secret. It is a known agency and the plans of Operation Northwoods are no more a Conspiracy Theory just because they where kept secret then any of its other actions that the CIA plans or performs on a daily basses that are all kept secret from the general public. Secondly, Operation Northwoods was not a conspiracy within the CIA either. Not one CIA member kept it a secret from anyone who should have known about it. It other words the protocols and the chain of command for this plan was followed precisely as they should have been. And because of that fact, it was shot down, the architect of the plan was fired, the plan never took action and it was well documented which is why we know of the plan under the Freedom of Information Act.

Other theories were that this was a mob hit or carried out by Cuba or the Soviets. The UFO conspiracy theory is also stated in the more extreme manner.

This section also is half of the actual article, with the rest mainly being an explanation of the terminology and even mentions of fictional conspiracies. Very little of this article goes to treating conspiracy theories as a justifiable practice in critical thinking that like all legitimate studies can lead to rather ridiculous theories. For instance, there are legitimate questions about 9-11, such as the $100,000 given to Atta by a head of the ISI. There are also allegations that the 9-11 Commission due to its structure and the associations of its head with the Administration was unable to do a thorough and independent investigation, with it ultimately being little more than a coverup. In every case critical thinking demands some form of explanation or theory for such facts. For instance one is that the Administration is trying to cover up connections between Pakistan and/or Saudi Arabia and 9-11. This w\n",

If \"\"Keep\"\" individual pages were reasoned to be kept, why not conclude the the others are to go? Requirement for individual mentioning only works one way?\n",
      "Also, in one point you complain that there was \"\"no discussion about the individual redirects\"\". Well, that could also be because an argument applies to the whole list (a logic you disallowed explicitly). Then, when I do point to individually addressed Rs (here above, linked), you do not see a contradiction in that. Even worse, when I do demonstrate there are Rs named specifically, you respond here with but not everybody agreed with you. This does not undo my point that individual templates were addressed. Confusingly, here you are jumping the reasoning.\n",
      "As was repeatedly pointed out the most recent times that it was discussed the consensus was that at least some were useful and that there was no consensus for a prohibition on their creation or use. Here it is you introducing arguments from *outside* the RfD list at hand. Earlier RfD's outcomes as an argument? How am I allowed to argue with that? WhenI use an argument involving general sanity (not even stepping outside this RfD), it ends up in the bin. And, above I linked tot two more recent R deletion conclusions (a G6 \"\"non-controversial\"\" speedy! March 2013, and a full RfD-list deletion in December 2010), that contradict your reasoning. Also you write T: as a prefix or the use of such prefixes in general in the closing and XfD not RfD here. That is an expansion of the topic beyond RfD. Why is that allowed?\n",
      "It doesn't matter how long ago a consensus was reached - it applies until there is a newer consensus formed, it doesn't somehow expire.and Consensus can change, and older consensuses are often more likely to, but ....  No  was reached. Repeat: there is no consensus. You are repeating an editors' 2007 injection -not a conclusion- into an essay. With that, indeed it is irrelevant how long ago the irrelevance was written: today it is still irrelevant. II note that you took over this bogus claim from an editor. As for old or new 'consensus': can an admin research & report how many T:-redirect were deleted without RfD, over the years? Of course, they leave almost no trace for non-admins. But I'd like to see the numbers & arguments for all T:-redirect deletions since template space was introduced. Some 'consensus' must be visible in there too. There is no consensus. So there is no argument from that  non-existent consensus. And don't blame me for introducing \"\"history\"\" as a reason. \n",

      "Yes, you argued about specific redirects, but not everybody agreed with you. Out of logic. Why do you say this?

      "I just mentioned the social conflict, because the contemporary crisis of Judaism was less a conflict between Orthodox and Reform movement, but a social gap between a ruling minority, consisting of families which had bound together religious authorities, academics and wealthy merchants through marriages, and a ruled majority in the Jewish communities and town ghettos whose poverty had dramatically increased. This is not only the social context of the conflicts between Maskilim and Orthodox Rabbis or Maskilim and Reform Rabbis, but also between Orthodox authorities and mystic movements like Hasidism. Hasidim in Galicia and Bukovina usually understood much better the problems of the poor population than any Maskilim among the West Yiddish Ashkenazim in Alsace or Western regions of Prussia. And Polish nationalists and among them, Polish Jews who lived in the larger Shtetl and visited the universities in Wilna, Warsaw, Cracow and Lemberg, formed a governing elite in the Sejm of Lemberg – the parlament of the crownland Galicia. The rural communities of Galicia was another “uncivilized” world for modern Jews in Vienna, Paris, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. Nachman Krochmal from Galicia as a student of Hegel must have appeared like a mooncalf. Their hopes focussed on a revolution in 1848 and it failed again.\n",

      " Moses Mendelssohn certainly belonged to the privileged minority of the Schutzjuden and his circle was the upper class of Prussia, but this does not mean that they were not disappointed about the backwards conditions in Prussia, whatever faith they had. Wealthy members like the brothers Humboldt or Polish aristocrats were very engaged to improve the social conditions. They founded universities, hospitals, they improved the working conditions of coal miners etc. If I compare them with wealthy people today in Germany, I can assure that they were much less ignorant. Otherwise they were also very intolerant people (especially around Fichte in Jena) like the demagogues who cause the hep hep progroms, so Hegel and his pupils had to go the ghetto to protect their inhabitants...\n",
      "\n",
      " But like David Friedländer Moses Mendelssohn’s social sphere had an impact on his concept of modern Judaism. As a pedagogue he wanted to teach Jewish children German, Hebrew and Greek, but he refused Yiddish as a corrupt dialect, which finally meant to refuse the prospering culture (literature and drama) of East Yiddish and the Ashkenazim world from Wilna to Bucarest. From the point of view of Alsatian Ashkenazim, Mendelssohn was admired as a radical philosopher of Haskalah, but the reason behind his radical attitude was the extreme pressure of assimilation, that the Jewish population had to suffer in Prussia. For this reason I was a little bit surprised about your categorization of Moses Mendelssohn as an Orthodox Jew. Conversion finally remained the main access into the ruling elite of Prussia which can be easily analyzed by the cynical statements of Heinrich Heine (especially his commentaries of the Pietist circles around the children and grandchildren: “He [Felix] is the grandson of the great philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, but he has nothing better to do than to set the lamb’s piss into music!”).\n",

Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many \"\"the Nazis\"\" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the \"\"Nazis\"\" who came from \"\"Greenland or Mars\"\" or \"\"Nazi allies\"\". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. \"\"The German-led Nazi occupation\"\" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the \"\"General Government\"\" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. \n",

Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that. Every Jew who survived the war in Poland is a Holocaust survivor and it does not matter if he managed to survive Auschwitz, Cracow Ghetto or by hiding in the forest.

The list of artists who are similar and influenced by the Happy Goodman family are on MTV's site (and doesn't even need to be included as it was just a \"\"verification\"\" source), among other statements to support what I typed are on the group's site: \"\"Their influence is still felt in many singing groups of today.\"\" Lastly, the info is covered on the singer's Wikipedia article.

      " \n",
      "First off, the info to support these statements are already explained within the artist's articles that they are linked to. Jon Gibson is \"\"overly\"\" sourced on his article, I made sure of that as a user with a different user name/ip/id in the past. Secondly, iTunes/TCM/GMA/CBN/CCM and the radio sites as well as the artist's actual websites are valid sources. I removed all sources Walter said only had \"\"books\"\" and \"\"albums\"\" listed, although if [you] scroll down or look for a different tab to see the \"\"bio\"\" or \"\"description\"\" sections, it would confirm what my entry claimed. The above 17'ish sources listed in another section were ones I removed and I did not need to be advised what was wrong with them, they are only being \"\"saved\"\" for future reference. Third off, this article didn't give any diversity which was an element I wanted the genre to reflect. Within the About.com that was recently removed and within the actual article of the artists (ie. Randy Stonehill), this statement can be verified. It gives a better idea of the veteran and popular CCM artists that the article didn't mention, those who are significant and some award winning \"\"record breakers\"\" (if nothing else just diversity in race/nationality such as Carman and Kirk Franklin which I provided reliable sources for).\n",

      "Anything to do with the CFL.  No one cares.  So what.  Not relevant.  Also this multi-national \"\"American Football\"\" angle deserves a big, fat yawn and another so what.  We know who Bud Grant is, we know who the Minnesota Vikings are, and there's only one football league on the planet, and it's NOT the pimple-faced CFL.  And nothing anyone has ever done in the CFL merits any notice whatsoever, most particularly diluting the great contributions of this great man to a great team.  All that other trash is a distraction away from what's important, and subordinates the significance of the man, the team and the game to a whole bunch of irrelevant people that don't care anyways.  This is what happens when ivory-towered (and foreign) academics write articles they have no connection to.  Any 8th grade Minnesota drop-out understands who Bud Grant is and why he's significant, however international egg-heads might get the impression that this is a refined and polite sport played to illustrate the deep and shared spiritual values between the United States and our irrelevant neighbors to the north, instead of smash-mouth warfare on an American Gridiron managed by giants like Bud Grant.  You can take your international, touchie-feelie, swami-guru political correctness and stuff it.173.174.222.48  \"\n",

Having said that, the expert POV by PressTV does even employ the term \"\"anti-Imperialist\"\" verbatim to describe the Houthis. Russia Today also suggests that the struggle is part of the post-colonialist movements' struggle against imperialists and colonialists. Likewise, the author in the linked paper from Taylor & Francis identifies the same anti-imperialist themes in Hussein al-Houthi's thoughts. Furthermore beyond these sources, the very fact that Houthis' antagonists are well-known to be in alliance with the living reality of US Imperialism and the blatant reality of the ongoing war against Yemen are themselves obvious clues reaffirming the nature of the struggle by the Houthis as being anti-Imperialist in nature. Houthi leaders have also numerously stressed that they are aspiring for independence from foreign influence (namely US and Saudi) as already mentioned in the article.

The Karankawa Indians, a group of five nomadic, linguistically related groups including the Cocos, Cujanes, Karankawas proper, Coapites, and Copanos, occupied the area from Galveston Bay to Corpus Christi Bay during the late Spring and Summer months. Evidence of the Karankawas near present-day Kemah was discovered back in the 1890s. This discovery will be discussed later in the article.

On August 24, 1824, the Mexican government granted a labor (approx. 177 acres) of land to to a settler by the name of Michael Gouldrich. Gouldrich was listed as one of Stephen F. Austin’s first colonists in 1826, a widower over 50 years of age engaged in farming and stockraising. His land was located on the south bank of Clear Creek, where the creek flows into Galveston Bay. Oddly enough, Gouldrich disappeared from historical record after his recorded receipt of the land grant. No historical records or accounts identify him with any development of a settlement, homestead, or right of way at his claim location. Odder still, there is no record of his death. \n",

On several early maps of Galveston Bay dating back to that time period, the name “Flanders Grove” or “Flanders Labor” appears in the vicinity of the present day town of Kemah, at the mouth of Clear Lake. The place-name has ties to a New Hampshire native by the name of John Flanders. John was the son of Levi and Mary (Sargent) Flanders and was born in Salisbury, Massachusetts. John had been in business with his father in New Hampshire. No record exists concerning the nature of business John and his father owned, although apparently at least a part of the business they conducted dealt in real estate. In the time immediately prior to John's move to the Texas territory, he and his father had a disagreement over a mortgage held by John on a piece of property owned by a widow. John wished to foreclose and his father opposed it. The disagreement developed into bad feelings and John left home, never communicating with his family thereafter.\n",

A notation in Austin’s Register of Families reads, “Flanders is to be included as a colonist although he takes no land.” Flanders, a 32-year-old  single farmer at the time, had arrived in the Galveston Bay region in mid to late December 1930. It is believed that his first place of residence was in Anahuac, Texas, on the northern tip of Galveston Bay. There, he acquired a house and a lot. However, he was not listed on the 1834 census of Anahuac and it is believed that somtime between early 1931 and the time of the 1934 census Flanders made the purchase of William Vince's land. Since the 1934 censuse does not record Flanders' name as a resident of Anahuac, it is reasonable to assume that he was probably living on his Clear Creek property by that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly enough, John Flanders was listed among the dead at the Alamo. He was one of thirty-two men, commanded by Captain George Kimball, who entered the Alamo on March 1, from Gonzales. Why he was with the men from Gonzales is unknown. Flanders was a Private under Kimball, 36 years old at the time of the Alamo seige, and still unmarried.\n",

      " THE MYSTERY HEIRS \n",
      "\n",
      "With John Flander's death came some interesting and mysterious dealings concerning his estate that, of course, included the \"\"Flanders Grove\"\"/\"\"Flanders Labor\"\" tract. In 1841, Allen Vince, brother of the now-deceased William Vince and resident of Vince’s Bayou, Harris County, was named administrator of the John Flanders estate. The estate was said to consist of only the labor of land at the mouth of Clear Creek on the Southwest side. A petition for sale of the land, to satisfy debts, was requested May 28, 1844. The deceased Vince owed money for lawyer fees (in the case of Sawyer vs Vince in District Court). The land was appraised at $2.00 per acre and sold to Jonathan D. Waters on July 2, 1844 for $354.00. This transaction leaves open the questions of whether or not Flanders still owed William Vince any monies for the land purchase, and how much legal right Allen Vince had to sell the land and use the revenues to pay of a debt on behalf of his brother's estate, instead of keeping the Flanders estate intact.\n",

I only noticed one obvious error in the numbers, that is the sentence(s) \"\"Lägren hade då totalt 382 besättningsmedlemmar från kvarstadsbåtarna\"\" and \"\"Leiren hadde da totalt 382 besetningsmedlemmer fra kvarstadbåtene\"\", where the number 382 conflicts with other numbers given. It is correct that the cited source gives this number, but it has to be either a misprint or meant to include more. The book  gives a good overview of the (number of) prisoners and what happened to them. Apart from that, I think that most of the ships should also have their own articles, as the Kvarstad article covers only a few days of their total lifespans.   \"\n",

I myself have two siblings that have gone to both Afghanistan and Iraq in the past 3 years as part of their service to this country. I was so fortunate to not have been eligible to be in harms way due to having been born with only one kidney. Not a day or sometimes an hour goes by that I won't hope they are well, and that their compatriots in arms are as well. I cannot think of what it must feel like to be the parent or spouse or child of those killed in action. We owe a debt to all of them we can never repay. My siblings are educated and not prone to believing propaganda and they both feel that we did the right thing when it comes to Iraq, regardless of the presence of WMD. This world is becoming smaller everyday...how much room is there for governments that pose a threat to their neighbors? Beyond any shadow of doubt in my mind, the USA and it's allies and the entire world were incredibly patient with Saddam Hussein, but the time had come to do something and I do not believe that we could afford to continue with diplomacy. As worded in UN resolution 1441 that meant SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. We had already done everything else we could do...what was left but to go to war? Some have argued that there never were any WMD, that Saddam behaved the way he did because it gave him strength with his people because they admired his defiance. However, WMD's are not something to take an action of wait and see. A leader must lead, regardless of the consequences, and must accept his political fate based on the outcome. It is my hope that democracy will be born in Iraq so that those persons there can begin to enjoy in freedoms the rights most of us in the western world take as normal. 11:45, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n",

According to the sources, Favre actually spent over an hour on the phone with Lions coaches, who were connected with Favre by then-team president Matt Millen. That story is not \"\"unsubstantiated\"\" and the use of anonymous sources is completely normal and accepted in journalism. Calling the story unsubstantiated is a violation of WP:BLP, and implying that it was incorrect because of the lack of \"\"named sources\"\" is an arbitrary standard that violates WP:NPOV. In addition, in the third source you provide, Favre admits that he did have a conversation with the Detroit executive, and that \"\"Favre said former players and coaches exchange information all the time.\"\" That doesn't disprove anything Glazer said, and in some ways seems to support it.

The analysis by  Skip Evans illustrates this confusion and provides a reliable source that the claims of the DI are not necessarily valid.  That's one way to establish the controversial nature of stories about the DI which contrast the published claims of the DI to published remarks by signatories like Salthe and Davidson ridiculing the DI's interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want a reliable source that the article by Chang is controversial in its own right, on multiple points, you can take a look at the article's Ask Science Q&A; page on the NYT wherein Chang responds to commentary and criticisms of his piece, and admits that parts of it are slanted toward highlighting the anti-evolution signers and not the pro-evolution ones.  Chang says, \"\"This article focused on Discovery's petition and thus I did not interview evolution supporters.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elsewhere, you have good evidence that there are evolution supporters among the 103 initial and subsequent signers, notably including Bob Davidson, whose story came to light and is featured in the main Wikipedia entry on the Darwin Dissent Controversy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This intentional snubbing of evolution-supporters among those interviewed by Chang for comments misleads readers about the statistical mix of those who signed the petition, giving some people the impression (per the desires of the DI) that all signers are variously \"\"anti-evolution\"\" or \"\"Darwin dissenters.\"\"  The contemporaneous analysis by Skip Evans reinforces that element of the controversy.\n",
      "\n",
      "When one realizes that Chang focused the story on the anti-evolution signers (many of whom joined after DI went public, and when one observes that Chang fails to solicit a quote from Picard (even though he mentions her name), one is left wondering which side of the fence she (and others of the 103) reside on.  The purpose of all this is to cast doubt on the unverified presumption (suggested by the existing section which I am forbidden from touching) that Picard belongs to the anti-evolution dissenters.  In other words, I am saying that some of the Wikipedia editors evidently fell into the trap which the DI set, luring readers into believing that all 103 scientists adhered to DI's dubious characterization of them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The length of the intervening piece needs to be longer than the section it precedes, because the current section adopts without proof the thesis that Picard is among those belonging to the anti-evolution dissenters.  The proposed intervening section is designed to examine the evidence for the unproven thesis adopted in the existing section and determine whether the evidence for it is credible or conclusive.  As you well know, a proof is typically longer than the theorem.  What's in the proposed intervening section is an examination of the omitted proof, in which the outcome appears to be that the missing proof does not seem to exist, and in fact there is good evidence at hand that the dubious thesis adopted by the existing section is simply false (and therefore unprovable).  If it is false, then it is also potentially libelous. Therefore, establishing the truth or falsehood of the thesis is crucial in order to protect Wikipedia from inadvertently publishing false and defamatory material that slipped through the filters intended to examine the evidence with a keenly skeptical eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "What any Wikipedia editor happens to know for a fact about the status of the petition in the intervening years is not evidence that anyone whose name appeared in nationally printed ads back in 2001 had the slightest inkling of what the DI was up to in the meantime.  Perhaps Wikipedia editors found this out by doing painstaking research on the DI.  Stanley N. Salthe said in 2006 in the Times article we are examining that he had never heard of the DI.  That's well-sourced evidence that some of those who signed had no clue that the DI even existed, let alone was maintaining a growing list of names.  Therefore one cannot draw any verifiable conclusions about what most of the 103 original signers knew of the DI prior to the 2006 Times story.  \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the reasons the story is controversial is because it fails to point out that the DI had reprised and evolved a 2001 petition that predated any of the disputed assertions regarding its inherent meaning or its re-interpretion as a testimonial in favor of DI's political agenda.\n",

      "The answer to your question in Gaulish language is that the so-called Vulgar Latin, which should be called a Latinized Italo-Celtic idiom instead because the spoken language of the Romans (Osco-Umbrian or Sabellic language and not Latin, already essentially a written language) the 'Proto-Italian' was so similar to the Continental Celtic languages that only the lexicon and the pronunciation differed a bit, and could almost be considered a dialect of Gaulish as it contained the same substratum, unlike the Insular Celtic languages. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, in reality no one can assert that Gaulish is an extinct language because we don't know enough about it before the Roman conquest and probably many 'Latin' words were already used by the Gauls before their first contact with the conquerers. At the most 'assimilation' could better describe what happened to that language. Both, the Proto-Italics and the Proto-Celts (Veneti) originally come from the Bell-Beaker culture and lived in a dialect continuum for a long time. In fact, Celtic is more a culture (brought by a Thraco-Cimmerian aristocracy) than a language family except for Brythonic and Gaelic languages which are both quite different from each other because of their respective substratum as mentionned above. Moreover, Proto-English (or Proto-Frisian) spoken by the Belgae was already used in Britain as well as in some parts of northern Gaul (Gallia Belgica) by the time of the Roman invasion, then the Belgic tribes just kept speaking the same language during and after the Roman time.\n",

      "I'm okay with Fletcher's approach, frankly.  Yes, there are relevant qualms about calling it a \"\"mosque\"\" since that's not all the planned center would be, but there would be facilities for holding prayers and services, and really the distinction between mosque and prayer room in this sense is a semantic distinction.  If there were a line in the first paragraph of the lead qualifying that it's not solely a mosque project and perhaps even the word \"\"mosque\"\" isn't strictly correct, I'm okay with the use of that word in the title.  But it has to say \"\"near Ground Zero\"\".  NickCT's comment about how WP:COMMONNAME should be the sole arbiter of this matter I think doesn't recognize that there is a spirit to the rules that trumps the letter of the rules.  Wikipedia is not a place to spread misinformation.  Calling the page \"\"Ground Zero Mosque\"\" despite the fact that the term misrepresents where the mosque facilities will be, and despite the fact that reputable sources are choosing not to use the term because it misrepresents where the mosque facilities will be, flies in the face of the idea that we're supposed to be reflecting what the WP:RS sources are saying.   \"\n",

I think you're correct about Kudpung, but there are several differert ways to make your point without directly attacking Trypto. For example, you could have informed him that according to Kudpung's absurd recall criteria, Trypto is no longer allowed to participate in the recall process. Of course, criticizing Kudpung is like shooting fish in a barrel, so it's not very sporting. This is a guy who claimed, quite unbelievably, that the Wifione case was a good reason to keep the tools bundled and adminship as high a bar as possible in the very face of evidence that showed otherwise.  Wifione was able to get away with mischief for five years precisely because adminship is an elite process that protects and rallies around its own.  If the tools had been debundled, Wifione would have been desysopped at the first sign of trouble.  Trypto probably isn't aware of any of this or Kudpung's hilarious recall page, which is literally designed to prevent anyone from recalling him!  Go read it if you don't believe me.\n",

      "I too have no very clear idea about how to word an RfC, other than that it should be in relation to specific proposed changes to the MOS and not something vaguer. I also think it's very important to keep to the issue of diacritical marks in the original orthography of the language, and not stray into either additional letters (like eth or thorn) or the use of diacritical marks in transcription/transliteration (like retaining accents when going from πότε to póte or marking long vowels by macrons in transliterating a number of languages, including Greek and Japanese). These are separate issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problems, for me, are primarily in the first paragraph of WP:DIACRITICS, which is evasive, muddled and inconsistent:\n",
      " – this is just evasion. Their use or non-use should be motivated, and hence should be encouraged or discouraged according to the strength of the motivation.\n",
      " – this encouragement to count \"\"hits\"\" just results in muddled policy, apart from the problem of the weasel word \"\"general\"\". However, this bit seems clear that the \"\"modifications\"\" are to the same word, i.e. can be treated as stylistic modifications.\n",
      " This seems to me not to be consistent with the sentence before: is \"\"the common name\"\" here supposed to be with or without the added diacritical marks? \"\"[V]ersions of  word\"\" above should mean that \"\"the common \"\" is the same with or without the diacritical marks.\n",
      "Is it possible to re-write this paragraph to achieve consensus? I don't know.   \n",
      "\n",
      " Agreed those are separate issuesAgreed the first quoted passage is evasive, but motivating use or avoidance of diacritics seems to be the sticking point.  Did you have some particular direction in mind?  My take has been that if reliable sources show that their use is normal for the names in question that they should be used here, except where particular subjects eschew them. E.g. for a baseball player named Eddie Sandoval we'd give him as Eddie Sándoval if some reliable sources did (it can't be based on a majority of English language sources, since majority of them ignore diacritics entirely, as a matter of editorial/publishing convenience). It's the same principle that we can cite a single source for Eddie's birth date and place even if most sources don't mention them.  A fact does not have to be provided by every single source to be considered reliable.  And it's not a matter of sources conflicting (analogous to giving two different birth dates); some giving only Sandoval without the diacritics is like some sources giving a birth year but not a full birth date; it is incomplete information, not conflicting information.  On the other hand, if Eddie himself is quoted saying he doesn't use the diacritic that should be a trumping factor (unless WP totally ditches subject preference in all areas, which seems unlikely given the number of discussions going on to make more allowances for subject preference all over the place).  This can apply to geography, too (Santa Fe, New Mexico is \"\"Santa Fe\"\" not \"\"Santa Fé\"\" despite the popularity of the diacritic in certain circles; the official name of both the city and the county are \"\"Santa Fe\"\" with no accent. People frequently cite WP:OFFICIALNAME as if it were a policy, but it's actually just an essay, it may not accurately reflect the nuances in cases like this, and people often cite it without actually understanding what it says to begin with (it's frequently misinterpreted as being against use of official names, when it's really only against using them when they're directly unhelpful to readers, while otherwise we would almost certainly use the official name)I'm not sure \"\"general\"\" in the second passage is actually a weasel word, rather than just lack of clarity.  It's not clear if it means the predominant use in reliable sources generally, the predominant use in general-audience sources, or both.  The inclusion of \"\"and reference works\"\" strongly suggests the former.  Regardless, the \"\"hit-counting\"\" aspect is a problem because of the aforementioned facts that a) English-language sources tend to ignore diacritics for their own conven\n",

Even the Duchy of Poland, the Polish dukes pledged allegiance to the empire and held territory as fief. Only in 1025 did Boleslaw I Chrobry declare himself king and died the same year.

Whereas the version before was properly cited: \"\"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: \"\"The Ends of the Universe,\"\" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.\"\"\n",

      "As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an \"\"eminent physicist\"\" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.\n",

Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an \"\"eminent physicist\"\" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.\n",

Broadly speaking, to be fair to all parties concerned, let's acknowledge that a) damaging quotations are a part and parcel of partisan politics, b) there is debate about whether and when such quotations are legitimate, because c) some can be taken out of context, while d) different politicians exhibit different speaking styles and such styles can be the source of parody and such parodies are often based on at least some degree of truth, and e) sometimes politicians really are dumbasses.  Taken in a broader context, that is how artististic political characaturists and comic impressionists make their living.  Did Carter really smile broadly and instantly?  Did Ronald Reagan really say \"\"Well\"\" at the beginning of sentences?  Where would we be without Dana Carvey and Rich Little?  Obviously, this is an issue that both you and I feel strongly about.

But once you started using the number of GA reviewers you have managed to trick into thinking you didn't misquote sources as justification for trying to get me blocked/banned, I suddenly had a massive incentive to bring to light the fact that the so-called GAs you advertise on your user page all contain serious sourcing errors.\n",

For if the British capital could be reduced to chaos, the task of the invading armies would be enormously simplified (...)

For three months I did not reply because I believed that they would stop, but in this Mr. Churchill saw a sign of our weakness. The British will know that we are now giving our answer night after night. We shall stop the handiwork of these night pilots.' Three days later, on 7th September, the Luftwaffe abandoned its offensive against the sector stations and began the assault on London.

      "\"::::::First off, Miles and Blume came to the same conclusion, and Blume said he did interviews, so I'm assuming Miles didn't pull his statements out of his behind and actually talked to some residents about the riots. That would be the logical conclusion since he's one of the few in Lhasa for the riots, so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever? Even if Miles didn't interview anybody, Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here. Miles already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started? Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police? I already addressed your \"\"proof\"\" of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled. You are free to actually read what I say. And someone who attributes flag burning and pro-tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred, but because of nationalism (and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence/autonomy) has no right to criticize how the current article is written. Your own \"\"proof\"\" is 100% presumptuous, while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said. Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about (James Miles), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.216.252.71.154  \n",

That in Starčević's political career the term \"\"Slavosrb\"\" was used exclusively for enemies (as he saw them) of Croatian independence ? The main \"\"Slavosrbs\"\" were Strossmayer, Germans, Hapsburg monarchy, and the so-called \"\"Khuen Serbs\"\"- the Serbs living in Croatia and affilliated with the  hated political regime of oppression. How come that vast majority of political representatives of Serbs in Croatia, more than 98%, had been, during the most oppressive period in the 19th century,  collaborators of Khuen regime ? Truly-these Serbs (or Orthodox Vlachs who nationally \"\"awoke\"\" as Serbs in mid- and 2nd half of the 19th century) had fully deserved the \"\"Slavosrbs\"\" tag in Starčević's lingo-unlike the descendandts of Orthodox Vlachs who were Starčević's followers (Stjepan Miletić, August Harambašić, Dušan Kotur, Dušan Vlaisavljević, Milan Ogrizović,..). No one can rationally deny anyone's ethnic affiliation, this is certain. The fact that Starčević did this to the descendands of the Orthodox  Vlachs is not a sign of political wisdom, or even ordinary logic. But, it must be underscored that he reacted to the denial of Croatian ethnic affiliation promulgated by Vuk Karadžić's pan-Serbian ideology. And this must not be forgotten: who had begun with this game of denial ? Who wanted another people's extirpation ?

We have some people in the Australian community (both on and of wiki) who only call the round ball game football (or maybe association football) and get offended/upset/angry by the word soccer due to previous negative connotations of the word. Others use the word football exclusively for another code, most commonly Australian rules football, and only use soccer (without any intended offence) for the round ball game. Then you have another group who are happy to use either term, depending on context or to avoid any possible ambiguity. What proportion of the population is in each group depends on location, age, era, ethnicity/cultural background, etc. So there is no single consensus.  I'm for soccer if it avoids confusion of codes (such as a in a multi-sport stadium article or a suburb article), but using football is ok if a dedicated article (such as a team or player article), all with a piped link to association football (a term which is rarely used and can also be ambiguous in parts Australia with Australian rules football games played in competitions named Associations such as the Victorian Football Association). Extrapolating the no move decision in that RM about a single parent article to apply to every mention of the sport is invalid, in my opinion.

      "\"\"The data in the table have many sources, including both the primary literature and evaluated compilations.  The Handbook of Data on Organic Compounds, Third edition (Ref. 7) and the Combined Chemical Dictionary (Ref. 8) were important sources. Other useful sources of physical property data on organic compounds are listed in Refs. 9-19.  The values in the table for the normal boiling point and the melting point that are accompanied with uncertainties (in parenthesis) have been critically evaluated using the NIST ThermoData Engine (TDE, Ref. 20), designed to implement the dynamic data evaluation concept (Refs. 21-24).  This concept requires large electronic databases capable of storing essentially all relevant data known to date with detailed descriptions of metadata and uncertainties.  The combination of these electronic databases with expert-system software, designed to automatically generate recommended property values based on available experimental and predicted data, leads to the ability to produce critically evaluated data dynamically, 'to order.' The uncertainties listed are combined expanded uncertainties (level of confidence, approximately 95 %) representing the most comprehensive measure of the overall data reliability (Refs, 25-28).\"\"\n",

      "Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms \"\"vandlism\"\" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all. I know what's going on. I don't know why, but I don't have to, and I expect the motivations aren't interesting. Respond if you have anything to say.   \"\n",

      "Hello, Max, this is indef-blocked User:Doughnuthead speaking. I firmly believe I can finally be of positive use to Wikipedia, and I no longer feel the need to gain attention through malicious editing. I'd actually all but forgotten about all the nonsense i had caused in the previous years until i saw a funny picture online of a guy with a swollen head, which reminded me of my username. But more to the point, i realised that my ability to edit the talk page was barred. After taking a look at previous edits, i realised i was being a bit of a tube. You were right to take that ability away. So just a heads up that i can only edit on anon as this account is obviously still suspended. In terms of getting unblocked, i haven't made a single edit to Wikipedia in almost 3 years, and during this time i have matured enough to the point that i look back at what i was getting up to and think 'Oh god! Who was i even trying to impress?!' In terms of where i aim to get involved in on the website, I still hold a strong interest in football (soccer) related articles, along with hip-hop and old school rock related articles- hence my music taste. As it has been so long since I bothered to use the editing facility, I'll need re-shown how to work various parts of the site or whatever it's called. I only remembered how to request unblock by clicking on the 'edit' tab and noticing one of my old templates! Furthermore, I don't intend to be an overly active user on the site, as I begin my university course in September much of my time will be dedicated towards my studies, and so I intend to see Wikipedia as a hobby to input my thoughts and research every now and then. Finally, thank you very much for reading my request - I appreciate the time taken to do so and I apologise for my past behaviour. I was just a stupid kid (it lasted from age 12-15 if I recall!) and I hope to hear from you as soon as possible.

It would seem to me that considering the huge numbers involved, the petition is highly relevant to any discussion of, or article about, road pricing. As such I have added a link to Reuters news article about the petition, and I also think it is fair to add a POV flag, considering the debate and editing taking place with this article. Also, in answer to RichardVeryard's concerns about internet petitions, the one in question is hosted and maintained by the UK government, and the results are passed directly to the Prime Minister. All signatures are validated with a full UK address, presumably to be verified against the electoral register. The target recipient of the petition is well defined, and ballot stuffing, although admittedly possible, is far more difficult than for the vast majority of 'e-petitions.'\n",

      "\"Actually, I became interested in editing this very short article (amid Wikipedia's invitation for us to participate in the survey, ending November 3), when all newspapers were flooded with Burlesque King. Nograles was forced to run naked in the hotel. Now, I was not a Wikipedian then, but, when, the landmark acquittal suit was published, I took time to edit this tersely. Nograles placed 2nd to my 1975 counsel in civil case, Atty. Henry R. Villarica, 92.35% higher than Ferdinand Marcos' 92.35% trimmed from 99% due to Marcos blunder in political law subject, in an En Banc review of his test results, 1939. Villarica owns more than 100 pawnshops, and is a very close friend-business assoc. of my brother, in gold and (they have 41/2 ha. Sta. Maria, Bulacan) fighting cock farm. I don't know Ateneo Law School Nograles, but due to the bar rating 2nd place, he is so brilliant. Now, in my 6,500 edits, I happened to have seen and edited like this controversy in bios of USA Senators, etc. So, I just follow the Wikipedia pattern. The difference between Dante Tinga and Nograles, is that, the former was cleared by the Court, but, the Nograles issue of censoring publication by libel lawsuit vs. the naked running, was condemned after Court acquittal for lack of evidence. In Nograles, the acquittal is best Wikipedia evidence to go forth with the edit on Nograles bio-naked thing. Remember the Beatrix of the Netherlands IP address fiasco caught by Wiki scanner? On August 31, 2007, Queen Beatrix’s royal family affirmed that Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, 38, and his wife Princess Mabel Wisse Smit edited the entry on Wikipedia which described Mabel’s relationship with slain drug baron Klaas Bruinsma (using the queen's palaces’ computer). The changes were found by Dutch media using Wiki Scanner - the entry which states Mabel provided \"\"incomplete and false information\"\" about Bruinsma was changed to just \"\"incomplete information\"\" in January 2006. My point is, in Tinga and Nograles, irrespective of Court acquittal or clearance, the publication of the bribe and Nog's U.P. Oblation run, respectively, with reliable sources, licenses us, editors, to add \"\"the thing.\"\" On short edits, I respect IT and other editors, since, it is a matter of style. If I were not a judge or lawyer, or if I were not an A.B. communication, editor, then, like IT and math editors, I would edit with a sentence or 2. But I keep my edits to 3 sentences for this reason: links die in time due to pay per view, and, scholars or readers of Wiki must be provided with a choice, to read more meats or essential ingredients. Also, the libel suit was filed by Nograles, et al. and the subject is the naked run. Now Nograles withdrew due to affidavit of desistance, but, the other complainant did not, and the Court decided based on trial's evidence. So, with more reasons must the edit be there and at the very least, even a sentence, but the essentials of the naked run ought to be there.\n",
      "Final point. I do not personally know Tinga, but in 1978, I hired a lawyer of Santiago, Tinga, Fornier Law Office, to handle my simple Malolos case. Tinga became congressman and had been well known for this controversy, it is of judicial notice in IBP. Personally, I ignored these, until Douglas Anama, my text mate, the husband of Felipa Borlongan Anama, our Assistant Clerk of the Supreme Court (with the equivalent salary and rank of CA Justice) repeatedly approached me to consult dwarves, due to their case which Tinga decided against him, that's his family home. Tinga is not the only one who had these bribery things; Ynares-Santiago and M. Nazario (remember the Ramos notable contempt fine) shared the pie. My point is - the Court would instead put to rest the issue by fine or contempt. But for us editors, we just follow the pattern in USA bio of senators and public figures. Hence, my edit is well copy pasted from Wikipedia good articles on sub-section controversies. But of course, with all due respect to your edits. Sorry, for my TLDR, but it is so informative.

      "\n",
      "Hello. I am contacting you because you are one of the editors/admins who is still active now, and was aware of the notoriously disruptive editor User:Betacommand, a.k.a User:Δ (Delta). As you probably know, he was eventually banned after a third arbitration case, due to the way he conducted himself in the pursuit of his main interest on Wikipedia, WP:NFCC enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you may not know, is that he has evidently returned and has been editing as User:Werieth since 2012, in violation of that ban. After just a year, Werieth is already causing the same sort of disruption that Betacommand did - you may experience some deja vu by reading reports made about Werieth such as the one at the top of this AN archive. There are already several others. A quick perusal of Werieth's contributions will also reveal the same Betacommand-like self-assured approach, grounded in the belief that their edits are always \"\"100% correct and 100% according to policy\"\" (when the reality was that he made basic errors and pushed policy boundaries at a rate that, while acceptable in ordinary users for a time limited period, was found to be unacceptable in an editor with the edit rate and communication issues Betacommand had, especially given their inability to change)\n",
      "\n",
      "I and others have already tried to expose his return via these sock puppet investigations, although as you can see, it's not getting far. That's not for the lack of an answerable case though - you can see the latest summary in this post. Most of the obstruction can be put down to the usual dysfunctional and counter-productive aspects of Wikipedia governance, which of course will always aid experienced WP:GAMErs like Betacommand.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you may or may not be surprised to learn that the people obstructing this investigation the hardest are three admins whose own conflict of interest with regard to Betacommand/NFCC is best demonstrated in their own words - Black Kite (repeatedly deflects attention away from Werieth and onto accusers), Kww (blocks accusers, and has already unblocked Werieth once) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (has basically declared all out war on anyone who even whispers that Werieth might be Betacommand).\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this post is to raise awareness about his return, and hopefully persuade one or more of you to resubmit that SPI with the evidence I'm sure you will be able to compile using your own knowledge of Betacommand's characteristic traits. At the very least to prompt you to put his talk page on your watch lists and regularly review his contributions (although obviously, don't waste your time trying to deal with any issues you see on the flawed basis that he is just any old user).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also obviously, you should also raise a red flag every time you see one of those three admins trying to further suppress the inevitable exposure of his ban evasion. If his return is to be covered up for an unnecessarily long time, it should at least be done simply through general incompetence, rather than obvious COI based abuse of the tools/trusted position of admin. A few emails to the arbcom members who dealt with Betacommand also probably wouldn't go amiss - if ordinary admins aren't bothered about this particular user's return (and you will remember, blinded by their enthusiasm for having someone, anyone, perform NFCC enforcement edits, a great many of them were unwilling to even admit his particular approach to that necessary work was a problem), \n",
      "\n",
      "Betacommand's clandestine return to Wikipedia is bad enough as it is given that he has simply resumed where he left off in the NFCC enforcement field, with several users already having wasted a lot of time having to deal with him as if he were a legitimate user. But obviously the nightmare scenario if the cover-up is allowed to continue for another year, is if Werieth/Betacommand decides script assisted batch editing is not fast enough for his liking, and decides to take an altogether faster approach - possibly even trying to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff;=prev&oldid;=43661105\n",

He is an unusual fellow in that he was apparently an atheist (according to his own conception) who was already studying to become a doctrinal minister which runs counterintuitive to my expectation of those who study theology.

However, from these data one can assess what importance should be attached to the Rodgers study.

After fitting a linear regression model to these data he concluded that: \"\"There is no evidence that hard shell helmets have reduced the head injury and fatality rates.

OWB needed to face what he faced there, and wikipedia, and OWB, will be better off if this process isn't pretended away. you said something about \"\"i don't know what went on with you two\"\". really? all that went on was utterly public. i've had no private comm with OWB. so if you don't know what went on, then you didn't pay attention. if you're not paying attention, maybe you might consider stepping back and not jangling your admin keys so readily.\n",

After reading about Aussinanis and writing a message to you, I clicked on the Uranium mines in Namibia link and now realize you have made all the entries there. May I point out some detail that might just be important as far as Wikipedia is concerned. There is a major distinction between a mine and an exploration project. Currently only Rössing, Langer Heinrich, Trekkopje and Husab can be called mines. Husab is in the process of construction, so one can call it a mine. Valencia is called a mine because there is a signboard on the road that says \"\"Valencia mine\"\", but they never advanced beyond the mid-exploration phase. The reality is that none of the other projects are further than advanced exploration. Even Trekkopje is technically still constructing, but have actually shut down because of the poor economy. Some of the Reptile projects (e.g. Omahola) and Zhonge Resources have received mining licences but it is unlikely that they will be developed soon; the uranium price is far too low for economical extraction and will remain like that for some time to come.\n",
