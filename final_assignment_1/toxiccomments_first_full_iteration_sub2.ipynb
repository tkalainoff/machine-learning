The reason I used sockpuppets was to avoid harassment from user: Dibo who immediately reverted all my edits, ,  and  when I forgot to log and branded me a sockpuppet of some previous user, here  which the checkuser proved did not exist . I got into a revert war with user: Tancred and user: Dibo who from the contributions, seemed to devote their time exclusively to making trouble and aiding each other in edit wars, as is shown here, ,  as well as in the earlier case regarding user: Ehinger222 who they erroneeouslly accused me of being. After several days of edit warring with user: Tancred over the right to call rugby league football, football,(surely a neccessity and not erroneous), user: Tancred's vandalism to the rugby league nations template here , The names of various sports on the Marconi stadium site  and whether the a-league franchises should be referred to as clubs(part of their franchise names, e.g.Queensland Roar FC is a franchise and not a club, but takes the name of a club for marketting reasons) or franchises, and whether minor premiers were premiers or not. Tancred has a history of edit wars, exemplified no better than here. I was banned by user: Chuq although my last free edits from here were this , , my last was this .  is where I made an argument for my case for the A-League case. Earlier, I had asked Chuq to please get a non soccer admin to help sort it out made in language not too different to chuq's .  Funnilly enough user:Chuq sent no warnings to user:Dibo and user:Tancred despite their equally uncivil and accusatry of vandalism here , (I was not one at that stage, as I was not trying to misuse the system and eing honest enough not to use this account to try to sway the argument),  , (note the term POV rubbish). I felt I was hard done by and resolved to annoy the blockers as much as they had annoyed me before resuming as my previous identity and making a large number of useful contributions before being bogged down by a piece of shit like user:Dibo who provoked this whole encounter. User:Dibo and User:tancred are the ones who should be banned if any justice is to be done, and I am resolved upon annoying the whole lot of you unless I am unblocked and the usefullness of my <500 edits is acknowledged as actual contributions and user:dibo recognised as the edit warrer that he/she/ it is.\n",
