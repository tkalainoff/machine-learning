term,definition
machine learning,Machine do the work for me.
machine learning,"The process of teaching a computer over iteration how to ""think""/process"
machine learning,Machine learning is using quantitative data classification and analysis to help people better making descions.
machine learning,Training machine to understand human's cognition.
machine learning,the use of algorithms to inform a program of its next action or to manipulate data for a single purpose
machine learning,machine learning is the process of analyzing data in order to synthesize a result or prediction.
machine learning,training to predict
machine learning,synthetically adjusting future behaviors based on past mistakes to reach a certain desired outcome
machine learning,A series of algorithmic procedures that process certain input and produce certain output
machine learning,The process of artificial programs' iteration on better understanding/predicting a defined domain
machine learning,Some results that came out from the machine with the input data and ordered algorism.
machine learning,the ability for the machine to infer information / meaning from the data on its own
machine learning,Using algorithms to have a machine recognize patterns in a data set
machine learning,finding patterns based on large amount of data
machine learning,It could be a form of information or knowledge that have been trained by human intelligence.
machine learning,"Machine Learning is creating patterns for machines (AI), which allow them to predict user behavior and improve the initial model they use"
machine learning,"Humans are believed to be born with a ""natural intelligence"" if you will. It led them to build devices that were theorized to act on their behalf. These devices got really sophisticated and eventually were given an intelligence of their own so they could carry out certain functions internally without needing routine check-ins from the outside world. They were made to act as humans, collecting informations, making decisions, and executing them independently. That would be what I call machine learning."
machine learning,computers/AI can learn from users' experience by algorithms and models
machine learning,A method to generate results from applying different statistical computations based on a certain dataset
artificial intelligence,machine imitate human
artificial intelligence,Teaching a computer how to behave on its own accord using a certain set of rules and experiences.
artificial intelligence,a synthetically created thing that can learn
artificial intelligence,computer program that is operating without set of instructions (ability to learn on itself and made its own decisions without human intervention)
artificial intelligence,Intelligence from computational result.
artificial intelligence,a technique to simulate human-beings' learning process
artificial intelligence,A series of algorithmic procedures designed to think like a human or think better than a human
artificial intelligence,human made computer systems that can act like human?
artificial intelligence,"an attempt at allowing a machine to teach itself how to complete a task, occasionally with mixed results."
artificial intelligence,"I may have jumbled the definition of AI with machine learning, as seen in the previous response. I do believe that AI is a more advanced form of machine learning, which could be seen as the foundation upon which AI gets built. Both belong to the same branch of computer automation."
artificial intelligence,technology models that are trained thoroughly in multiple facets that are able to interact back with us
artificial intelligence,Artificial intelligence is a process of work by a machine in a framework that has been created by Human.
artificial intelligence,Intelligence created by human which can be utilized with code to fulfill the purpose.
artificial intelligence,"Technology that mimics the intelligence of a person by utilizing machine learning to educate itself, thus having a sense of 'intelligence' by 'improving' by itself."
artificial intelligence,"The ability of computer software to implement, create and update specific models"
artificial intelligence,"Using technology/machine learning/data science to mimic ""intelligence"" or ability to solve a problem that we find in living organisms (like animal's ability to think, but plants, fungi, etc. also posses intelligence)."
artificial intelligence,AI is using repetitive machining learning process to help machine building their own knowledge system to mimic real humanbeings.
artificial intelligence,"same with ML, but with more computation powers and complex datasets"
artificial intelligence,An idea/practice of human made entities with abilities to make better judgements literably
kitty cat,A cute fluffy animal lol
kitty cat,little cat
kitty cat,baby cat! I guess I saw a kitty cat on your shoulder few minutes ago :)
kitty cat,a cat?
kitty cat,baby cat vs general saying a creature?
kitty cat,"fluffy creature filled simultaneously with mischief, pointy things, and cuddles"
kitty cat,cute mammals with tip ears and a tail
kitty cat,a new AI virtual cat that promises it will never die and lick your toes as much as you want
kitty cat,Japanese cartoon character
kitty cat,"baby feline animal ; ""meow"""
kitty cat,oh thats a adorable little cat
kitty cat,cat that lives at home
kitty cat,"a cute name for a little cat, usually a house pet"
kitty cat,my roomate
kitty cat,__ a fun way to call cat?
kitty cat,"Cute, domesticated feline. Likes pets and treats."
kitty cat,"ML related - I can’t relate it to anything I know, otherwise - a small cat?"
kitty cat,A term of endearment for a cat
kitty cat,"kitty cat, as opposed to just ""cat"" or ""kitty"" has an emotive element involved. It refers to a cat of course, a feline domestic pet, but referring to it as ""kitty cat"" means calling on it with more excitement :o"
